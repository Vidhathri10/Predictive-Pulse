# Predictive-Pulse

Predictive Pulse is a web-based machine learning application that predicts a person's blood pressure stage (Normal, Hypertension Stage-1/2, or Hypertensive Crisis) based on various health parameters. The model is trained using healthcare data and is deployed through a Flask-based web interface.

This project aims to provide early detection and stage classification of hypertension, enabling users to assess their cardiovascular risk in a few clicks.

**Model Details:**
Trained on labeled hypertension dataset

Model: RandomForestClassifier

Achieved high accuracy in classification of 4 categories:

Normal

Hypertension (Stage 1)

Hypertension (Stage 2)

Hypertensive Crisis

**Technologies Used:**

Machine Learning: scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy

Web Framework: Flask (Python)

Frontend: HTML, CSS

Deployment Ready: Can be hosted on Render, PythonAnywhere, or Heroku
